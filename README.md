## Overview

Audio classification is a key problem in many applications like speech recognition, music genre classification, environmental sound detection, etc. This project uses a CNN to extract features from audio signals and classify them into different categories.

## Features

- Preprocessing of audio data into spectrogram or mel-spectrogram inputs.
- CNN model architecture tailored for audio classification.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Support for common audio formats.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-cnn.git
cd audio-cnn
````

2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*If there is no requirements.txt file, install the common packages:*

```bash
pip install numpy librosa matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

### Prepare the dataset

Place your audio dataset in a folder structure expected by the scripts. Typically:

```
dataset/
├── class1/
│   ├── audio1.wav
│   ├── audio2.wav
│   └── ...
├── class2/
│   ├── audio1.wav
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Train the model

Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

*(Replace with the actual training script name in the repo)*

### Evaluate the model

Run the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Dataset

Describe the dataset you used or recommend datasets such as:

* UrbanSound8K
* ESC-50
* GTZAN (for music genre classification)

## Model Architecture

The CNN model typically consists of convolutional layers to extract spatial features from spectrogram images, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

*Example:*

* Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
* MaxPooling layers
* Dropout for regularization
* Dense layers for output

## Training

* Use categorical cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
* Optimizer: Adam or SGD
* Metrics: Accuracy

Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs in the training script.

## Evaluation

* Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
* Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
